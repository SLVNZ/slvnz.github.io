			<p style="font-family: barlow">
			
                The SLVNZ 2.0 system is a customised tabletop role-playing game system inspired by D&D 5e and FATE systems. 

			</p>

            <h2 id="Zarlar_ve_Eylemler" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt;"> Dices and Actions </h2>

			<p style="font-family: barlow;">Actions in the game refer to any action you wish to take with your character. While some actions can be performed directly without requiring a skill, some actions in SLVNZ 2.0 require the use of dice.  The dice to be used may be made using <strong>d10</strong> and <strong>d20</strong> as deemed appropriate by the game master.				</p>
		
            <p style="font-family: barlow;">The outcome of any action performed with the dice varies in direct proportion to the height of the number reflected by the dice. If the game master does not specify a customised limit or criteria for the number(s) in question, the consequences of the number(s) reflected by the dice according to the system can develop as follows:			</p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">The overall balance of actions should be taken into account when choosing whether to use 10-sided or 20-sided dice, depending on the game master's preference. A 10-sided die can create a more balanced range of outcomes within a narrower range, whereas a 20-sided die can create a higher probability of success and a more severe penalty for failure. 			</p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>Critical Failure:</strong> No matter what kind of dice is used to determine the result of the action, if the result is 1, the action attempted will definitely fail. In addition to this failure, the result may be unfavourable to the character attempting the action and/or the characters around him. Also, in the case of a critical failure, any extra value the character has is not included in the critical condition.

            </p>

                Majik, a master thief, is trying to infiltrate a freighter named "Sorvalas" at the largest dock in the pirate city of Sulgaran. Majik manages to climb up the stern of the ship from the sea and uses a 20-sided die to try to open a window to the cargo hold from the outside. The result of the die is a 1. Majik not only fails in his attempt to open the window, he loses his balance and falls into the water, making a loud noise. This noise attracts the attention of the civilians and guards around the pier, and several people head towards the area to see what is happening.
                
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>Absolute Failure:</strong> A certain failure, which is very similar to a critical failure, is a failure in which, unlike a critical failure, the character is not in a negative situation. In this case, the character's extra values are again not included.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>Failure:</strong> In case of failure, the character fails to perform the action he/she was trying to perform. However, unlike the other two failure cases, if the character has any extra value for the action he/she is trying to perform, the result of the die can be changed by adding it to the number. If the added value does not exceed the specified limits, the action cannot be performed and results in a failure.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>Conditional Success:</strong> It is the partial success of the action attempted to be realised or the realisation of the action resulting in an event that causes trouble for the character and/or the characters around him/her.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>Success:</strong> It is the successful conclusion of the action that the character tries to realise.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>Critical Success:</strong> It is the definite successful outcome of the action attempted to be realised. In addition to this success, in a similar approach as a result of critical failure, a situation that may have a positive effect on the character who attempted the action and/or the characters around him/her should be included in this result.

            </p>

                After falling into the water, Majik, the master thief, tries to hide on the wrong side of the ship to avoid being spotted by the people gathered around. He uses a PRIVACY roll while trying to hide. The roll results in a 20. Without anyone noticing, Majik pulls himself out of the water by grabbing onto a ledge at the stern of the ship and manages to disappear completely upside down from the dock. Meanwhile, in the ship's storeroom area, a mate opens the storeroom window and looks out to see what has fallen, sees nothing, forgets to close the window and returns inside. Majik takes advantage of the confusion and enters through the opened window.

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                In some cases, characters have qualities that can benefit them in performing specific actions. These qualities emphasise the most basic characteristics that any character possesses.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>STRENGHT <span style="color: blueviolet;">(STR)</span>:</strong> It is the quality that determines the actions that the character can perform with muscular strength. These actions include lifting a heavy object, the force applied when hitting something, hanging on to something during a fight, etc. The higher a character's strength attribute, the higher their capacity to perform actions that require this attribute.


            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>DEXTERITY <span style="color: blueviolet;">(DEX)</span>:</strong> It is the quality that the character needs in actions such as moving fast, reacting suddenly, avoiding, etc. The higher a character's agility, the more agile and mobile they are. This quality can also help the character to hit the opponent with his weapon, fist or kick in melee combat, while it can also affect his ability to avoid incoming blows in defence.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>ENDURANCE <span style="color: blueviolet;">(END)</span>:</strong> It is the quality that characters need to be able to withstand blows, survive destructive situations, maintain consciousness in severe situations, or endure pain. It also affects a character's STAMINA. The higher a character's STAMINA, the more STAMINA they have.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>WILLPOWER <span style="color: blueviolet;">(WIL)</span>:</strong> Similar to endurance, it is the character's mental endurance; in other words, it is the quality that the character will need in any mental struggle. These struggles can be characterised as being under the influence of any magic, infiltrating the mind, being under the influence of telepathy, etc. against his will. The higher the WILL quality of a character, the MANA value will increase in direct proportion.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>INTELLIGENCE <span style="color: blueviolet;">(INT)</span>:</strong> It is a quality that affects the character's historical knowledge of the past, their knowledge of a subject, and their ability to comprehend difficult puzzles and riddles. At the same time, characters with high intelligence have an advantage in learning, perceiving and memorising information. This means that characters with high intelligence have a higher learning curve for some information than a normal character.

            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                
                <strong>WISDOM <span style="color: blueviolet;">(WIS)</span>:</strong> It is the quality that characters will need in their communication with other characters, in situations such as understanding the truth underlying the behaviour of characters they find suspicious, trying to grasp whether a person is lying or not. At the same time, since characters with lore will have more open perceptions, their awareness is positively affected by the advantage of the lore attribute. Similarly, characters with lore are more competent in recognising energetic auras and diagnosing the intensity of these energies.

            <h2 id="Beceriler" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Skills </h2>


            <p>
                Similar to attributes, there are skills that characters will need for certain special situations. Although skills are similar to attributes, they may not be used as frequently. Skills are divided into two categories: <strong>Basic Skills</strong> and <strong>Special Skills</strong>.

            <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">SPECIAL SKILLS</h3>


            <p style="font-family: barlow;">

                Special skills include any skills outside of basic skills in which the character wishes to develop. These skills are entirely dependent on the player's creativity and how they wish to personalize and advance their character. Some examples of special skills are as follows:
            
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-family: barlow; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
            
                <strong>Cooking:</strong> Determines a character's proficiency in cooking.
                <br>

            </p>
            









                        <!-- ENERGIES SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Energies" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Energies </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                In SLVNZ 2.0, it is possible to perform magic or, more appropriately, to channel energy. To channel energy, one must master the various types of energy present in the universe. These energy types are divided into <strong>Basic Energy Types</strong> and <strong>Special Energy Types</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">BASIC ENERGIES</h3>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Basic energy types are the kinds of energies that can be commonly found in the universe, and they are considered simple to access and channel. These energies are generally those that characters can easily learn at Wizard academies or from other characters who have previously learned to channel them.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Evocation Energy:</strong> As the name suggests, this type of energy involves channeling energy that can be used to cause harm. Examples of energies that can be created with destruction energy include fire, explosions, lightning, etc. However, destruction energy does not always lead to fragmentation and destruction. Many healing spells inherently use destruction energy.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Divination Energy:</strong> This type of energy is primarily used for divination, locating places, determining locations, and making small interventions in the course of fate.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Conjuration Energy:</strong> This type of energy is used to create creatures with a certain solidity, summon spirits, or create weapons/shields from energy. It is also used to create portals that open to different places.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Abjuration Energy:</strong> This type of energy allows the casting of spells for protection, creating barriers, locking, etc.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Transformation Energy:</strong> This type of energy is used for spells that physically change the shape of an object, manipulate it, or create a false appearance.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Enchantment Energy:</strong> This type of energy is used for spells that manipulate the perceptions of beings mentally, attracting them in various ways. The mentioned attraction can manifest as charm, intimidation, implanting different thoughts into the mind, entering dreams, putting to sleep, etc.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Illusion Energy:</strong> This type of energy is used for creating illusions that can attract or distract attention visually or audibly.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Death Energy:</strong> This type of energy is primarily associated with causing death, disease, and misfortune or directly facilitating the emergence of different attributes related to these events. Examples of such situations include summoning the dead, animating dead bodies, communicating with the dead, spreading disease, cursing, etc.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">SPECIAL ENERGIES</h3>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Special energy types are more specialized and less accessible compared to the basic ones, or they require certain conditions to be met. These types of energies are generally not encountered frequently in nature but can be rarely found or brought out with special effort.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Faith Energy:</strong> This type of energy is typically embraced by Clerics and Paladins, who channel it based on their faith and derive strength from the ancient beings they worship.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Pact Energy:</strong> This type of energy is directly used by Warlocks. It arises when a superior being grants their powers to another being, and it strengthens as the bond between the two beings grows.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Blood Energy:</strong> This type of energy grants the ability to control blood present in the environment as a primary element.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Chaos Energy:</strong> This type of energy allows the control of unstable energy present in the universe. Beings who attempt to control chaos energy often find themselves in a state of turmoil due to the chaotic outcomes that can arise from its intense use.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Dark Energy:</strong> This type of energy allows the use of the true darkness that exists in the universe. This energy can exist by consuming the life energy of beings. It is generally associated with evil. To perform dark magic, a being must consume or release the darkness within them, which inevitably results in self-consumption or the destruction of their surroundings.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Light Energy:</strong> This type of energy is completely opposite to dark energy. However, like dark energy, it also consumes the life energy of the being who attempts to use it, leading to the emergence of immense energy.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Spirit Energy:</strong> This type of energy allows beings to use the spirits housed within their bodies. Spells performed with spirit energy are often considered extremely powerful because they can directly affect the soul. However, to channel spirit energy, a being must use their own soul. As a result, the use of spirit energy carries the risk of leading to the being’s death through self-consumption. However, spirit energy has a renewable structure over time. This renewal can be accelerated by exploiting the energy of captured souls through spirit stones or similar methods.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                <strong>Life Energy:</strong> This is the rarest type of energy, found deep within the soul, that gives even the soul the power to exist. Life energy is the most valuable thing a being possesses. Although most beings have only a small amount of this energy, even a small quantity can enable the casting of powerful spells. Unlike spirit energy, a being can only replenish consumed life energy by draining it from another being.
            </p>











            <!-- ABILITIES SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Abilities" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Abilities </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                In addition to their attributes, skills, and energies, characters also possess abilities that they can use by incorporating these elements. These abilities are shaped according to the path the player wishes their character to follow. Character abilities are divided into two branches: physical and energetic. Physical abilities consume STAMINA as a resource, while energetic abilities may consume MANA, SPIRIT, KI, or LIFE energy. However, some physical abilities may also consume energetic resources.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">PHYSICAL ABILITIES</h3>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Physical abilities are mainly the abilities needed by characters who specialize in close combat or use ranged weapons. As they generally require muscle strength, physical abilities consume the character's STAMINA, but sometimes they can be combined with energy to transform into abilities with different effects. This form of physical abilities is known as <strong>Martial Arts</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">ENERGETIC ABILITIES</h3>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Energetic abilities (Spells) are the result of drawing chaotic energy from nature into the body, controlling it, and transforming it into the desired form when released. Some characters may choose to specialize solely in energetic abilities, but characters who focus on physical combat may also wish to develop their energetic abilities. This should not be confused with the martial arts aspect of physical abilities. For example, a character with martial arts abilities may enhance their strikes by spending a certain amount of MANA with each hit. However, a similar character may use an energetic ability to enchant their weapon with an element using only MANA without the need to spend STAMINA.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION</h3>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Both types of abilities may have effects that occur instantly or last for a duration. Some abilities that remain active for a duration require focus or concentration to maintain, and characters have limitations in their ability to focus or concentrate. Focus is used for physical abilities, while concentration is used for energetic abilities.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                When focusing on or concentrating on an ability, if the character is not proficient in this, they cannot maintain focus or concentration on more than one ability at a time.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                For abilities requiring concentration, the character focuses their mind to keep the energy they've generated from dispersing. For abilities requiring focus, the character maintains their stance by concentrating their senses on the flow of the ability. Any damage the character receives during focus or concentration threatens to disrupt it. The GM is responsible for setting a threshold based on the type and strength of the attack that hits the character. If this is not desired, the success table on Page 1 can be used as a reference. In this case, there are only states of disruption or maintenance of concentration/focus, and critical failure, conditional success, and critical success states are deactivated in such scenarios.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Characters can develop their capacity for focus or concentration. This means increasing the number of <strong>focus slots</strong> and <strong>concentration slots</strong> they have. Each active ability requiring focus or concentration fills a slot, which is emptied when the ability ends. You can refer to the Character Development section for information on how to improve focus and concentration slots.
            </p>


            







            <!-- EQUIPMENT SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Equipment" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Equipment </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                In SLVNZ 2.0, the use of equipment by characters holds a special place. The equipment characters possess can directly affect their attributes. Wearing heavy armor may provide superior defense while negatively impacting the character's mobility, agility, stealth ability, and other characteristics. Similarly, the weapons equipped can have similar effects. The different types of equipment and their impacts on the character's attributes are specified in the tables below.
            </p>

            <table style="width: 70%;">
                <h3 style="font-family: barlow; color: blueviolet;">Armor Attributes</h3>

            </table>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Armors allow characters to protect themselves from physical attacks and many energetic attacks. However, as the level of protection increases, it also brings some disadvantages. These disadvantages may not be limited to the attribute and skill penalties shown in the table. For example, depending on the GM's choice, a character may receive a negative modifier to their awareness skill due to wearing a helmet.

            <span style="font-family: barlow; font-style: italic;">(*) The shield type capable of performing a Full Block Stance.</span>

            <p>
                Shields are a type of equipment that provides extra protection for characters in addition to armor. A character can protect themselves in two different ways by shaping their shield usage style. These and similar situations that can be used with shields and many other abilities are called Stances. The stances that can be used with shields are the Battle Stance and the Full Block Stance. The shield types that can use these stances are the Normal Shield and the Tower Shield types. Other shield types rely on the character's agility attribute for blocking.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;"> BATTLE STANCE </h3>

            <p>
                This is the normal combat stance in which the character holds their shield. In this stance, the character uses the block attribute of the shield they are wielding combined with their own block ability to block incoming attacks.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;"> FULL BLOCK STANCE </h3>

            <p>
                In the Full Block Stance, the character positions themselves to hold their shield in front, covering their body. In this stance, the character achieves a NET BLOCK against attacks coming from the direction they are facing. NET BLOCK allows the character to avoid damage from all physical attacks, but it may cause the shield to take damage and the arm to be strained. It still requires a defensive reflex against attacks that may come from below.
            </p>

            <p>
                While in FULL BLOCK stance, the character's movement ability is halved, and they receive no STRENGTH BONUS for physical attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                While in FULL BLOCK stance, the character can perform physical attacks to the front, right diagonal, and right side.
            </p>









            <!-- COMBAT AND CONFLICT SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Combat_and_Conflict" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Combat and Conflict </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Characters use the dice system they employ to determine the success rate of actions they undertake alone in battles or conflicts against others. The combat and conflict system comes into play in situations where two characters engage in sword fighting, subject each other to specific energies, wrestle, etc. In its simplest form, both sides roll a die in such situations. The side with the higher numeric value wins the encounter. However, in special instances like armed combat or situations involving energy manipulation, the number of dice used may vary depending on the nature of the action being performed. For example, in a duel between two characters wielding two-handed swords, the attacking side uses one die to determine the accuracy of the sword strike and a second die to determine the force of the swing. <strong>It is recommended to roll these dice sequentially in a physical environment</strong>. In a digital online setting, they can be rolled simultaneously, but the results should be listed from left to right, with accuracy first, followed by force.
            </p>

            <p>
                In light of the above explanation, the situations that can be followed in combat and conflict can be categorized as follows:
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">STANDARD CONFLICT</h3>

            <p>
                Standard conflicts include situations such as wrestling, blocking each other, lying, persuading, etc., where success and failure are determined mutually. In these situations, both sides generally roll one die each. The side with the higher numeric value, aided by additional points, wins the conflict.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
                Majik uses the Sleight of Hand special ability to try to steal a gold pouch from a man's pocket as he walks absentmindedly through a crowded street. In response, the man uses an AWARENESS skill die to see if he notices the attempt in time.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">
                COMBAT
            </h3>

            <p>
                During combat, characters usually use multiple dice to determine their attack actions. These actions are generally determined by attributes such as AGILITY, STRENGTH, ACCURACY, RESOURCE USE, ENERGY, etc. The actions that may develop during combat and the dice attributes used for these actions can be classified.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Melee Weapons:</strong> A character attacking with any melee weapon typically uses two dice unless there is a special or additional situation. These dice should be rolled sequentially, or if in a digital environment, the results should be listed from left to right, with the first die representing ACCURACY and the second representing DAMAGE/STRENGTH.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> Similar to melee attacks, ranged attacks generally use two dice. However, if the ranged attack involves energy manipulation, the number of dice used may exceed two, depending on the characteristics of the energetic ability. In ordinary ranged attacks (such as using a bow), a RANGED ACCURACY and STRENGTH die are used. However, when using ranged weapons that do not require strength (such as crossbows, muskets), only one die is used for accuracy, as these weapons have fixed damage values.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Defense:</strong> Characters can use a defense die to dodge or block any incoming attack. These dice are typically rolled using DODGE, BLOCK, or RESISTANCE attributes.
            </p>

            <p>
                In dodging situations, it is sufficient to exceed the numeric value of the attacker's accuracy die with the dodge die. However, the greater the difference between the attacker's accuracy and the character's dodge value, the closer the attack hits the intended spot.
            </p>

            <p>
                In blocking situations, if the character is not in FULL BLOCK stance, the chance of protection is higher compared to dodging. If the attacker's roll exceeds the character's block die by 6 points, the attack bypasses the shield and deals damage to the character. However, if the difference is less than 6 points, the attack hits the shield, damaging it and reducing the character's STAMINA. If the character's block value is higher than the attack value, the shield only suffers wear and tear while deflecting the attack.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">SPELL USE</h3>

            <p>The use and direction of energy start with simple forms but become more complex as they develop, requiring different approaches in terms of dice use. Also, spell usage almost always consumes MANA, SPIRIT, or LIFE energies as resources. While two or three dice are typically used for most spells, different types of dice may be added to align with the spell's definition or function as it becomes more specialized.</p>

            <p>
                A character needs an energetic focus to use a spell. These foci are usually natural materials with energy transfer capacity or items that have undergone various processing to gain this capacity. Common examples of foci include wands, focus crystals, and talismans. It is also possible for a character to cast a spell without a focus. However, a character attempting to cast a spell without a focus has a <strong>DISADVANTAGE</strong> on the dice rolls for the spell's success.
            </p>

            <p>
                Spell usage is based on two different fundamentals: Accuracy-based spells and force-based spells.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Accuracy-Based Spells:</strong> These spells are aimed at a single target and attempt to hit that target. In such spells, an ACCURACY skill die is always rolled first. Afterward, separate dice can be used for the spell's energetic force and factors like element, duration, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Force-Based Spells:</strong> These spells generally focus on creating a specific effect on an entity or an area without requiring accuracy. They include spells that cause effects such as mental attacks, explosions, burning, melting, etc., in an area, or producing different effects on a substance. Similar to accuracy-based spells, different dice rolls can be added to force-based spells, considering area, duration, range, and other factors.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">PHYSICAL ABILITY USE</h3>

            <p>
                Systemically and logically, the use of physical abilities is not very different from spells. The number of dice used for an ability may increase depending on the physical ability's characteristics. Generally, dice usage may develop sequentially as ACCURACY, STRENGTH, DISTANCE, SUCCESS.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION IN CONFLICT</h3>

            <p>
                Using physical or energetic abilities while in a focus/concentration state is an action that fills the slots dedicated to these states. While the processes for these states may be similar, their maintenance differs.

            <!-- CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Character_Development" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Character Development </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Throughout the game, players can develop their characters' attributes, abilities, and skills. This development process is possible through experience points that the character can accumulate by completing appropriate training. Experience points are accumulated using a 20-sided die, regardless of the type of die the game is played with.
            </p>

            <p>
                The type of training the character wishes to undertake is suggested to the GM, and if accepted, the character will undergo a 6-hour training session during the game. If there is any interruption during this training period, apart from breaks, the GM may decide to change the type of die used for experience points.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result of the training, characters receive a +1 <strong>Fatigue Condition</strong> point. If the character trains again while fatigued, they receive another +1 Fatigue Condition point. A character cannot train if their fatigue condition is 2 points or more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Characters can become mentally and physically fatigued. Aside from activities like meditation, working on energetic abilities can also lead to physical fatigue due to the energy flow within the body. For this reason, unless otherwise agreed upon with the GM, any development work on energetic and physical abilities will tire the character after 6 hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                The character's development process is divided into two different branches and formulas. These are <strong>Basic Development</strong> and <strong>Special Development</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">BASIC DEVELOPMENT</h3>

            <p>
                Basic development encompasses the processes by which characters can improve their basic attributes, basic skills, equipment proficiency, energetic proficiency, and resource pools. This process allows the character to level up by completing a 6-hour training or meditation session and rolling a 20-sided die to try to reach <strong>LEVEL x 80 Experience Points</strong>.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
                Majik wants to improve his strength. Majik's current strength score is +1. To increase this attribute to +2, he decides to train for 6 hours by lifting weights. The experience points required to reach +2: 2 x 80 = 160 experience points.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>

            <p>
                Special development involves the process by which characters can improve their special skills. Unlike special training in basic development, this process is built on the learn-by-doing model. In other words, a character gains experience points by rolling a die when using a special skill. The experience formula required to improve special skills is LEVEL X 100 Experience Points.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family: barlow; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
                Majik is developing his alchemy skills. Every time he makes a potion, the success roll also contributes to Majik's development process, helping him progress to the next level.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet; font-family: barlow;">ABILITY DEVELOPMENT</h3>

            <p>
                Many abilities have the potential to be developed beyond their basic level, both energetically and physically. This development process can be specifically determined by the GM, but some abilities are defined within the system. You can identify abilities that can be developed by looking for a special marker in the ability descriptions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Developing an ability may sometimes require a specific basic attribute, skill, or another ability to be at a threshold level. If there is no limit or condition for developing an ability, the classic development formula is applied. For example, to enhance a 3rd-level ability to unlock new effects or features or increase its power, the character needs to upgrade this ability to the 4th level. If there is no special condition or limit specified by the system or the GM (such as STRENGTH must be 3 points, DESTRUCTION energy must be 4 points, MARKSMANSHIP skill must be 2 points, etc.), the character must accumulate 4x80=320 Experience Points.
            </p>

            <p>
                Enhanced abilities can be used at their basic lower levels, but to benefit from the new effects or powers unlocked at higher levels, the abilities must be used at their enhanced levels. For example, a character who has learned the Fireball spell at a basic level of 4 can still use the 4th level version of the spell even after enhancing it. However, if the character enhances the Fireball spell to the 5th level to increase its range, they will not benefit from the additional range when using the 4th level version.
            </p>

            <!-- FEAT, ADVANTAGE, AND FLAW SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Skill_Advantage_and_Flaw" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Feat, Advantage, and Flaw </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Characters can have special effects due to their backstories, some abilities, items they carry, or other situations that may arise during the game. These effects can be temporary, conditional, or permanent on the character. These conditions may affect attributes, skills, abilities, or directly impact the player's role. For example, a character with a blind eye may have a FLAW that causes a -3 penalty to the AWARENESS skill for vision-related tasks. In another example, a character with night vision may have an ADVANTAGE that grants them a bonus to AWARENESS rolls in dimly lit environments. Additionally, situations such as illnesses and the difficulties characters may face due to them, or being more effective in certain situations due to sensitivities, can be included in feats, advantages, and flaws.
            </p>





            <!-- CLASSES SECTION -->

            <h2 id="Classes" lang="en" style="font-family: 'gandur new'; font-weight: 900; font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 100px;"> Classes </h2>

            <p style="font-family: barlow;">
                Although SLVNZ 2.0 doesn't have sharply defined classes, there are class structures in the game world that can be distinguished from each other due to the systems of abilities and skills they can perform. Unlike in other TTRPG systems, where there are very clear progression paths, these classes can be blended with one another.
            </p>

            <p>
                Class mechanics are particularly important in differentiating the magic-using characters' mechanics, allowing magic users to become more unique. Although a similar situation exists for characters using physical abilities, it can be said that this is more relevant to magic users. While there are similarities to other TTRPG systems, here are some basic classes that players can use for inspiration or directly incorporate when creating their characters in SLVNZ 2.0:
            </p>

            <h3>BARBARIAN</h3>

            <p>
                Barbarians are a class typically composed of characters built around raw strength and endurance. The most significant indicator of a character being in the barbarian class is their capacity to enter a partially controlled rage. A barbarian can stoke their rage in a controlled manner at certain intervals, entering a RAGE state. While in rage, a barbarian character receives significant bonuses to STRENGTH and ENDURANCE attributes, while attributes and skills like MIND and AWARENESS are similarly penalized. Of course, these changes in attributes and skills may vary depending on the barbarian mechanics established by the player. This is entirely up to the player's creativity and how the GM balances this creativity within the game world. For example, a barbarian may have abilities related to energy control. In rage bursts, this barbarian might gain the ability to use certain spells they normally couldn't. While in rage, their MIND attribute may increase with DESTRUCTION energy, but their STRENGTH and AGILITY attributes might decrease. These mechanics and similar ones are entirely dependent on the player's creativity. The GM is responsible for assessing how this creative mechanic affects the game's world and overall power balance and for accepting, rejecting, or balancing the mechanic with modifications.
            </p>

            <h3>WARRIOR</h3>

            <p>
                Warriors are classic close-combatants or ranged adventurers that can be encountered in many regions of the game world. However, a warrior character also has a high potential to develop themselves in various directions and make their abilities interesting. Like all classes, a player who wants to play as a warrior can develop their own mechanics and present them to the GM to bring them into the game. They can introduce new approaches by altering or enhancing existing abilities and movement kits. A warrior might be someone who fights in close combat with a sword, shield, mace, etc., or someone who supports their team from a distance with a bow, crossbow, musket, etc. Additionally, depending on the player's creativity, different energy manipulations can also be incorporated into the mechanics.

            <h3>PALADIN & CLERIC</h3>

            <p>
                Paladins and clerics are characters who draw their power and energy from the ancients. These characters occasionally establish spiritual connections with an ancient being they religiously believe in and worship, gaining access to their wisdom, power, and might. However, this power and might remain with these characters only as long as they uphold and continue the principles of the ancients they follow.
            </p>

            <p>
                The spells used by paladins and clerics draw their energy from FAITH. FAITH energy can be considered a type of energy that comes from the strength of the character's belief in the ancient they worship, derived from the bond formed between the ancient's presence and the character. To cast their spells using FAITH energy, they use talismans as focus items.
            </p>

            <p>
                Paladins and clerics perform rituals to connect spiritually with their ancients to develop their spells or learn new ones. While these rituals may sometimes require specific materials or conditions, they can also be performed without being tied to any material or condition. Experience points are gathered from these rituals. When characters accumulate the required amount of experience points for the spell they wish to learn, they undergo a spiritual test that helps them learn their new ability. This test usually occurs in the character's mind or in an unusual environment they are spiritually summoned to. At the end of this test, if successful, the characters learn the ability in a usable form. If they fail, a percentage of the experience points, determined by the GM, is deducted from the characters' totals, and they are expected to try again (It is recommended that the percentage to be deducted is determined by how close the character was to completing the test. The closer the character is to success, the fewer experience points they should lose).
            </p>

            <h3>WIZARD</h3>

            <p>
                Wizards are individuals who possess the most basic knowledge and control over the chaotic energy of the universe. They acquire their ability to manipulate energy not from any being or extraordinary event but from their developed skills in directing this energy. Due to the processes they undergo in learning and using magic, wizards may become proficient in writing spell scrolls. A proficient wizard can produce spell scrolls by using ink and parchment capable of capturing energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wizards, if generally trained or self-taught, can master many types of energy. They can cast various spells with these energy types, learn these spells from books written by other wizards, and significantly shorten the time it would normally take to learn spells using such resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                A wizard can gain proficiency in several different areas through training;
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Spell Scroll Production:</strong> The wizard can transcribe known spells onto parchment to make them usable by others.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Spell Creation:</strong> A sufficiently skilled wizard can develop a new spell. However, creating a new spell is far more challenging than learning any existing spell. This process involves designing the words and movements that will activate the spell, integrating the designated energy into these elements, and balancing it with the appropriate amount of mana. It is also crucial that the wizard is well-versed in the type of energy they wish to use for creating the spell. To ensure this, the wizard must have at least a +4 point in the relevant energy attribute. The <strong>Spell Creation Table</strong> can be reviewed for conditions related to this process.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are different stages to spell creation. If a wizard has trained at a comprehensive wizard academy, they will be informed about these processes.
            </p>

            <h4>Determining the Spell Concept</h4>

            <p>
                Before starting to create the spell, the concept of the spell is determined. The concept refers to the spell's function and, therefore, the type of energy it will use. After determining the type of energy, if the spell is a ritual, the materials to be used in this ritual are identified. Spell materials can be selected by taking inspiration from similar types of spells; materials with similar functions can facilitate the creation of the ritual spell.
            </p>

            <h4>Research and Experimentation</h4>

            <p>
                After the necessary determinations are made, the research and experimentation phase begins to direct the energy in the desired way. In this context, the wizard may study ancient texts related to magical energy for insight, consult knowledgeable beings, or directly attempt to manipulate the energy according to the concept they have set through experimentation. d20 dice are used to determine how successful the wizard is in creating the desired effect. One phase of the experiment is considered a standard training session and gives the same fatigue effects as spell training.
            </p>

            <p>
                To be successful or achieve a result in the above-mentioned process, the wizard must reach 100 experience points. However, this amount can be altered by the GM depending on the complexity of the wizard's goal or the type of energy. For example, a wizard may want to create an effect by attempting to use multiple types of energy simultaneously. In such a case, the target experience points required to achieve a result from the experiment could rise to 200 points. In another case, a wizard might want to create a spell using a rare or more difficult-to-manage type of energy. For example, if a wizard wants to create a spell using dark energy, the required experience points for the experiment phase could be set at 150 points.
            </p>

            <h4>Sketching the Spell</h4>

            <p>
                After successfully manipulating the energy or achieving an unexpected result through research and experimentation, the wizard prepares a parchment sketch that will serve as a draft for the spell according to the determined concept or will continue based on the unexpected result. This parchment roughly outlines the spell's general effects, range, duration, etc. Based on these elements, the spell's MANA cost and potential level are determined. It is up to the GM's discretion to present this cost and level to the player.
            </p>

            <h4>Testing and Development</h4>

            <p>
                After determining the remaining elements of the spell, the wizard must test the drafted spell in an environment. This testing phase is where the wizard tests and develops the draft, making changes to eliminate or enhance undesirable effects, adjusting the draft to balance the energy if it doesn't gather as intended, and modifying the form they wish to impart to the spell.
            </p>

            <p>
                This phase is the part where the wizard truly invests effort into creating the spell. It is when the spell, with all its effects, features, mana, and level known, begins to take shape. During this phase, the wizard works on the spell as if entering another training session, using a d20 in each session. Experience points are accumulated at a rate of <strong>100 x Spell Level</strong>. At the end of this process, with the GM's discretion, the spell the wizard was trying to create is finalized.
            </p>

            <h4>Making the Spell Permanent</h4>

            <p>
                The wizard, having created their spell, can transcribe the draft onto a clean parchment to make it learnable, usable, or developable by others. They can donate these parchments to academies or sell them to different places.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>SORCERER</h3>

            <p>
                Sorcerers are characters who, due to being born with it or as a result of an accident/incident, have energy flowing through their veins, allowing them to cast spells without the need for a focus. However, because the structure of the energy manipulation they can perform with this nature is out of the ordinary, the process they undergo in developing or learning new spells, as well as some of the things they can do in terms of spell usage, differs from normal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to their nature, sorcerers do not need to gather and channel energy with the help of a focus to cast spells. Their blood, and thus their body, assumes this role directly. This situation has a structure that can bend or break the normal rules of spellcasting. Due to this structure, sorcerers are limited to their own efforts when it comes to learning or developing new spells. However, they can speed up this process by seeking help from someone who has learned the spell or a similar ability they are trying to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sorcerers, during their development, may awaken extraordinary effects in their bodies, which they can weave into their spells. These weavings are called <strong>ENERGY FLOWS</strong>. Energy flows are skills that sorcerers can use in limited amounts without exhausting themselves. Unless they rest physically and energetically, their bodies cannot gather the energy needed for the flow. If energy flow is used beyond its limit, it starts to harm the sorcerer's body by causing fatigue. A fatigued and damaged body can suffer irreversible damage.
            </p>

            <h4>Energy Flows</h4>

            <p>
                Systematically, the types of energy flows that sorcerers can perform are limited in number. However, new energy flows can be created according to the player's creativity or the GM's discretion.
            </p>

            <p>
                Energy flows are quantified for usability and tracking. A sorcerer initially holds 2 <strong>flow charges</strong> at the basic levels. These charges increase as the character's spell levels increase. A character who learns two 2nd-level spells gains the ability to use Energy Flows. For each spell level they increase afterward, they add +2 capacity to these charges. A character who has exhausted their flow charges can continue using them without waiting for them to regenerate, just like other resources. However, as mentioned, this can lead to permanent damage to the character's body. Examples of this damage include permanent MANA reduction, mental or physical strain leading to permanent reductions in MIND/ENDURANCE attributes, or permanent penalties to the energy attribute in use due to the energy damaging the body. These examples are merely suggestions for the GM. They can be used or entirely different effects can be devised by the GM.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Careful Spell:</strong> Area-of-effect or randomly targeted spells cast by the character do not target or affect characters designated as allies. Each unit of Energy Flow used in this effect ensures that one chosen character is not targeted or affected.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Twin Spell:</strong> The spell cast by the character splits into two and targets an additional target. To activate this effect, the sorcerer must use an amount of Energy Flow equal to the level of the spell they are using.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Empowered Spell:</strong> Allows the character to reroll the damage die used for the spell. 1 Flow Charge is used to activate this effect. The new die roll value is accepted.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Distant Spell:</strong> The distance the character's spell can reach is determined by rolling a d10 or d20, depending on the type of die preferred in the system, and can increase up to 2 times. 1 Flow Charge is used to activate this effect.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Extended Spell:</strong> The duration of the character's spells that have a time limit can be doubled by rolling a d20. This effect can multiply. However, for spells with a base duration of 1 minute, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour, it can be extended to a maximum of 24 hours. For spells with a duration of more than 1 day, this effect can be extended to a maximum of 1 month; for spells with a duration of 1 month, it can be extended to 6 months. As the base time for the duration to be multiplied increases, the GM should balance it by increasing the amount of energy flow spent. 1 Flow Charge is used to activate this effect.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Quickened Spell:</strong> The character can speed up the spell they are trying to cast and use it as a bonus action. 2 Flow Charges are used to activate this effect.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Subtle Spell:</strong> The character can cast a spell without requiring any movement or speech. 1 Flow Charge is used to activate this effect.
            </p>

            <h3>WARLOCK</h3>

            <p>
                Warlocks are characters similar in structure to paladins and clerics, but they gain their powers from agreements with a superior being rather than from their faith in an ancient. In this context, a warlock uses the powers granted by a being known as a Patron according to the terms of the agreements they will make or have made with them. The energy type that warlocks command through the powers they use is <strong>PACT</strong> energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The number and nature of beings a warlock can make agreements with can be quite broad and flexible. In this case, a player who wants to play a warlock can request a patron that suits their playstyle and the personality they want for their character by agreeing with the GM. In response to this request, the GM can present a patron to the player character within the story or create a patron at their discretion.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most crucial aspect of the relationship and bond between a warlock and their patron is the agreement made between them. This agreement can be a comprehensive document consisting of hundreds of lines or a decision bound by a few clauses. This is also at the GM's discretion. However, if existing patrons in the universe are to be used, it is recommended to base them on these patrons' agreements.
            </p>

            <p>
                The development of the power granted to the warlock by their patron depends on satisfying the patron, except in extraordinary circumstances. This satisfaction may involve entertaining the patron, meeting their needs, fulfilling the tasks they assign, etc., depending on the patron's personality. These situations are termed <strong>Events</strong>. The difficulty levels of the events that the warlock will have to deal with will result in different types of rewards for the warlock after the events are resolved. These rewards can be new powers, valuable information, items, weapons, etc. While these rewards can vary according to the GM's discretion and the patron's personality and nature, the following table can be used as a general guideline for an idea.
            </p>

            <h3>WITCH</h3>

            <p>
                Witches closely resemble wizards in their learning, using, and developing magic. However, unlike wizards, witches can disrupt the structure of an existing spell to create entirely different effects related to the spell. This situation can be considered a combined version of a wizard's and a sorcerer's features, but it is not the same or related to having both classes simultaneously.

                Witches, while mastering spells, try to control the most savage and deadly form of energy found in nature (Dark Energy) to disrupt the spell. To control dark energy, one must know the dark language—a language predicted in legends to be a language created by the conscious will of dark energy to be used. Knowing the dark language requires more than just knowing a language; it also requires the witch to engage in a psychological struggle. This is because whenever a character attempts to use or interact with the dark language, they invite dark energy into their minds and bodies by opening the doors of their minds to the realms ruled by dark energy. During this process, the dark energy tries to manipulate the character's mind and body. If the character cannot find an external source to satiate this energy, they become the source themselves. In other words, using dark energy requires significant and different resources other than MANA. These resources are generally the life of any living being. Therefore, it is often seen that during the use of dark magic by witches proficient in using dark magic, effects such as the dimming of light in the environment and the reduction of vitality in the surroundings are common occurrences.

                If a witch chooses to use their own body as a source instead of an external one, the dark energy will begin to consume and rot the life in their body, starting from the area where they are trying to create dark magic. This rotting can be cured through advanced methods that can be learned by witches, but it is almost impossible for a being without these methods to find a cure for this rot.

                It is necessary to discuss the differences between witches and wizards in terms of spell development. These differences are generally;

                While a wizard can develop Fireball spells by increasing range, enhancing power, or expanding the area of effect; A witch can disrupt the structure of the Fireball spell to change its element, create different effects (fear, disease, curse, etc.) where it lands, or steal attributes from targets it hits.

                While a wizard can develop the Fog Cloud spell by increasing its spread area, extending its duration, or altering its density; A witch can disrupt the structure of the Fog Cloud spell to show hallucinations to entities within the cloud, engage in mental interactions, or create unusual effects.
